practice project with safe devops approach

This project is my place to experiment with new topics and fundamental skills I have to improve on. I will utilize a full safe devops approach, or atleast as much as I can while utilizing githubs tools. 

The goal will be that everything is versioned controlled as per safe devops guidelines.

## About

This project will be a fullstack application utilizing as many technologies as I want to learn. 

List as of now decided upon tech:

1. MariaDb
2. redis
3. .Net
4. GraphQl
5. Docker & docker-compose


Since I also want to adopt a modern workflow I have choosen safe devops. Here I will utilize practices for CI/CD, seperate release from deploy etc. Or as much as I can while utilizing the tools available for github.
Everything will be version controlled so that anyone can copy this project and just get started.
