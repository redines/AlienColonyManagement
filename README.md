practice project with safe devops approach

This project is my place to experiment with new topics and fundamental skills I have to improve on. I will utilize a full safe devops approach, or atleast as much as I can while utilizing githubs tools. 

The goal will be that everything is versioned controlled as per safe devops guidelines.
